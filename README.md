# Google-Calendar-Birthdays
Very simple Node.js app to add birthdays to Google Calendar from a .txt file.

# Steps
Feel free to use or fix this code.

Follow [Google's guide](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/quickstart/nodejs) to set up and obtain your credentials. 
Run "npm install" to get all the dependencies.
Change birthdays.txt to have all the birthdays with the format "Name - MM/DD/YYYY" or "Name - YYYY/MM/DD" and separated by a new line.

You can technically use this for any event but this was done with only birthday events in mind (whole day, yearly, summary and description based on birthdays).
